# Count-Univalue-Subtrees

# Problem Explanation
We need to count how many subtrees in a binary tree have all nodes containing the same value. A subtree consists of any node and all its descendants.

# Solution Approach
This solution uses a post-order depth-first search (DFS) traversal to efficiently count univalue subtrees from the bottom up.

# Key Logic:
Base Case: Empty nodes are automatically considered univalue

# Recursive Check:
First verify if left and right subtrees are univalue
Then confirm current node's value matches its children's values
Counting: Increment count whenever all conditions are met

# Important Edge Cases Handled:
Nodes with only one child (must match the existing child's value)
Leaf nodes (always count as univalue subtrees)
Empty trees (return 0)

# Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(N) - We visit each node exactly once
Space Complexity: O(H) - Where H is tree height, for recursion stack

# Example Walkthrough
Consider this tree:

      5
     / \
    1   5
   / \   \
  5   5   5
  
The three leaf nodes (5, 5, 5) each count
The right subtree (5â†’5) counts
The left subtree doesn't count (contains 1)
The full tree doesn't count (contains 1)
Total univalue subtrees: 4

# Why This Matters
This problem teaches:
Bottom-up tree traversal
Careful handling of node relationships
Efficient counting with recursion

# Perfect for strengthening your tree algorithm skills!
